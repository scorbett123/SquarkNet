An encodec inspired project used for my computer science NEA.

The write up includes much more detail on how this project works.

As a brief explanation of where things are:

# /model

This folder contains all code for defining and training the model.

# /inference

This folder contains programs for inference and the GUI.

# /evaluation

Quick and dirty code for evaluation, this wasn't part of the project which was handed in, and will likely require manual changes to get working.
